            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>I am a cybersecurity professional with a unique blend of experiences, including military service, freelance consulting, and continuous learning. My journey began in the United States Marine Corps, where I developed foundational skills in administration, compliance, and leadership. This military background has been instrumental in my transition to a cybersecurity career focused on vulnerability assessment and organizational defense enhancement.</p>
            <p>Outside of my professional work, I actively engage with emerging technologies, often conducting hands-on research with various devices and systems to better understand their security implications. This curiosity-driven approach extends to personal projects, including device security research and analysis. I maintain work-life balance through outdoor activities such as rucking and hiking, which provide both physical fitness and mental clarity essential for effective security analysis.</p>
