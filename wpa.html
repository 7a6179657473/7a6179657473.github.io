            <h1>WPA2 hash Gathering Project</h1>
            <p>Exploring Network Security and Wireless Authentication trends</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on analyzing WPA2 protocols, their vulnerabilities, and the techniques used to gather relevant network data securely and ethically examine it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the sequence of events during WPA2 authentication and encryption.</li>
                <li>Collect a wide array of hashes valid for Hashcat bruteforcing.</li>
                <li>Crack and identify hashes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>The project was conducted using ethical hacking techniques, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Network packet sniffing using software and hardware tools such as Wireshark, Pineapple MK7, and Pwnagotchi.</li>
                <li>Utilizing a Pwnagotchi device for mobile hash discovery while on the move.</li>
                <li>Analysis of WPA2 handshakes, distinguishing between half and full handshakes.</li>
                <li>Attacking the hashes using Hashcat, gathering successful and unsuccessful attempts, specifically utilizing the rockyou wordlist and combinations of rockyou with other small wordlists.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The study highlighted potential trends in end-user WPA2 configurations and provided insights into user behavior.</p>
            <p>Data gathering involved various tools monitoring the raw traffic of WPA2 routers. The main focus was on the 2.4GHz frequency, but occasionally 5GHz was targeted.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>By understanding the behavior and risks associated with password selection, this project aims to better understand popular trends in password security and the regions from which they are captured.</p>
            <p>During testing, an expected trend of personally named WiFi networks resulted in a higher likelihood of weak passwords.</p>
